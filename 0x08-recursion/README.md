This is project is all about a recursion and have the following exercise
'0-puts_recusion.c - prints a string followed by a new line'
'1-print_rev_recursion.c - prints a string in reverse'
'2-strlen_recursion.c - return the length of string'
'3-factorial.c - fucntion that returns the factorial of a given number'
'4-pow_recursion.c - function the value of x raised the power of y.'
'5-sqrt_recursion.c - function that returns thee natural square root of a number'
'6-is_prime_number.c - function that returns 1 if the input integer is prime number else return 0'
